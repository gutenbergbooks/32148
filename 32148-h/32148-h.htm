<h3>
PREFACE
</h3>


<p class="dropcap">
F<span class="dcap">or</span> many years I have pursued the practice of holding conversation
classes following my lectures on international law. The chief
characteristic of these classes is the discussion of international
incidents as they occur in everyday life. I did not formerly possess
any collection, but brought before the class such incidents as had
occurred during the preceding week. Of late I have found it more useful
to preserve a record of some of these incidents and to add to this
nucleus a small number of typical cases from the past as well as some
problem cases, which were invented for the purpose of drawing the
attention of the class to certain salient points of international law.
</p>

<p class="indent">
As I was often asked by my students and others to bring out a
collection of incidents suitable for discussion, and as the printing of
such a little book frees me from the necessity of dictating the cases
to my students, I have, although somewhat reluctantly, made up my mind
to publish the present collection.
</p>

<p class="indent">
I need hardly emphasise the fact that this collection is not intended
to compete either with Scott's <i>Cases on International Law, selected
from decisions of English and American Courts</i>, or with Pitt
Cobbett's <i>Leading Cases and Opinions on International Law</i>, both
of which are collections of standard value, but intended for quite
other purposes than my own.
</p>

<p class="indent">
I have spent much thought in the endeavour to class my incidents into a
number of groups, but having found all such efforts at grouping futile,
I therefore present them in twenty-five sections, each containing four
cases of a different character. Experience has shewn me that in a class
lasting two hours I am able to discuss the four cases contained in
these sections.
</p>

<p class="indent">
I have taken special care not to have two similar cases within the same
section, for although there are no two cases exactly alike in the
collection, there are several possessing certain characteristics in
common. It is one of the tasks of the teacher and the students
themselves to group together such of my cases as they may think are
related to each other by one or more of these traits.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It has been suggested that notes and hints should be appended to each
case, but the purpose for which the collection is published is better
served by giving the incidents devoid of any explanatory matter. Should
this book induce other teachers of international law to adopt my method
of seminar work, it must be left to them to stimulate their classes in
such a way as to enable the students to discover on their own
initiative the solution of the problems.
</p>

<p class="indent">
I gladly accepted the suggestion of the publishers that the cases
should be printed on writing paper and on one side of the page only, so
that notes may be taken and additional cases added.
</p>

<p class="indent">
I am greatly indebted to Mr Dudley Ward, of St John's College,
Cambridge, my assistant, who has prepared the cases for the press and
read the proofs. In deciding upon the final form of each case so many
of his suggestions have been adopted that in many instances I do not
know what is my own and what is his work.

1. <i>A Councillor of Legation in difficulties.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
In 1868 the French journalist L&#233;once Dupont, the owner of the Parisian
newspaper <i>La Nation</i>, became bankrupt. It was discovered that
this paper was really founded by the councillor of the Russian legation
in Paris, Tchitch&#233;rine, who had supplied the funds necessary to start

<p class="indent">
"An incident which is regarded with some seriousness by Belgians has
occurred at Antwerp. A balloon which for a time was observed to be more
or less stationary over the forts finally came to earth in close
proximity to them. It proved to be a German balloon, the <i>Dusseldorf
No. 3</i>, controlled by two men, who, on being interrogated by the
Commander of the fortifications, declared themselves to be merely a
banker and a farmer interested in ballooning in an amateur fashion, who
had been obliged to descend. The General commanding the Territorial
Division adjoining Antwerp was informed of the incident. On an inquiry
being opened it was found that the aeronauts were none other than two
German officers, and that the balloon forms part of the German Army
<i>mat&#233;riel</i>. The Minister for War was immediately informed, and he
has communicated the facts of the case to his colleagues. The inquiry
is being continued. In the balloon was found a quantity of photographic
apparatus."

</p>

<p class="indent">
During war between states A and B, an outlying fort of a harbour of
state A is being bombarded by the fleet of state B, and is in danger of
capture. Suddenly the white flag is hoisted on the fort, and a boat
flying a white flag and carrying an officer and some men leaves the
fort and makes for the flagship of the bombarding fleet. Thereupon the
fleet receives the order to cease firing. Shortly after this has been
carried out, the boat flying the white flag, instead of continuing its
course, returns to the fort. Under cover of this man&#339;uvre the
bombarded garrison succeeds in abandoning the fort and withdrawing in
safety.

6. <i>A South American "Pseudo-republic."</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
The following appeared in the <i>Times</i> of April 26th, 1904:
</p>

<p class="indent">
"The utility for the practical politician of the study of that branch
of sociology to which M. Lebon has given the non-classical name of the
psychology of crowds is amusingly demonstrated in the fact of the
efforts of the still nebulous State of Counany to materialize and to
attain a separate and independent existence among the South American
Republics. What is taking place would seem to be a simple phenomenon of
suggestion, induced by the example of Panama. The fate of the vague
territory known as Counany had been settled, as every one supposed, by
the arbitral sentence of the Swiss Tribunal by which this region, with
which France and Brazil had played diplomatic battledore and
shuttlecock for more than 175 years, was finally handed over to the
latter Power.
</p>

<p class="indent">
"Brazil has never, it appears, taken effective possession of Counany,
and the population, whose flag, if ethnographic differences were to be
symbolized in it, ought to be a sort of Joseph's coat of many colours,
are now apparently once more appealing to the civilized world to aid
them to secure a separate existence. What recently occurred on the
Isthmus of Panama, when a new State sprang full fledged into being,
would seem to have been an object lesson acting automatically on the
nerves of these Indians, whites, negroes, and half-castes, welding them
into a compact whole and giving them a self-consciousness craving
European sanction. Hypnotized by Panama, and, it may be, counting upon
the eventual support of one of the Continental Powers which has already
shown the world that Brazilian affairs are not beyond the range of its
diplomatic vigilance, Counany steps once more to the fore.
</p>

<p class="indent">
"A Paris morning paper, the <i>Journal</i>, plays the <i>r&#244;le</i> of
introducer of the new Counany Ambassador. This Ambassador is a certain
M. Brezet, who comes to France, in spite of the sentence of the
arbitral tribunal, as President of a State which is described by all
competent authorities as a <i>pseudo</i>-republic, summarily wiped off
the map as an independent State. M. Brezet, moreover, is a Parisian who
has served, it is said, in the French forces in Guiana. He is now for
the second time enjoying the confidence of the Counanians, strong in
the prestige won by his success in having repulsed the Brazilians who
sought dutifully to carry out the terms of the clauses of the Berne
Decree. 'After having prepared the military and administrative
reorganization of Counany, he has come on a mission to Europe to defend
the interests entrusted to him.' Such is the story reported by the
<i>Journal</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
"Counany, now described as the vast territory between the Amazon and
the two Guianas, is not merely a relatively accessible stretch of
coast-line and <i>Hinterland</i> for a certain enterprising European
colonial Power, which has already prospected in Brazil, Venezuela, and
the unknown world between the Amazon and the Orinoco. Counany is
likewise on the high road of sea communication between the south of
South America and the eventual link between the Atlantic and the
Pacific, known as the Panama Canal. The Counany coast-line is a
covetable strip of the South American coast which at more favourable
moments might even distract our attention from Morocco."

"A most painful impression has been created throughout Italy by the
confirmation to-day of the report that a young Italian journalist,
Mario Calvino, has been condemned to death by Court-martial in St
Petersburg. All that is known is that Calvino was arrested on a charge
of complicity in a plot for the assassination of the Grand Duke
Nicholas, that he was condemned with a batch of six other prisoners
after a very brief trial held within closed doors, and that he will be
hanged next Saturday. Many friends and colleagues of Calvino in Italy,
as well as in Russia, assert the impossibility of his complicity in a
Nihilist plot, and there prevails a general belief that his
condemnation has been due to a judicial error. In answer to
representations made to Signor Tittoni from Milan, the Foreign Minister
has stated that the Italian Ambassador at St Petersburg has received
instructions to do his utmost on behalf of the condemned man. Up to the
present moment it would appear that no result of his exertions has yet
been reported."

that town for about six months. He served with them in different
capacities until March, 1900, when he went to the Transvaal, and took
no further part in the war. In March, 1901, he was prosecuted for high
treason, but endeavoured to exculpate himself by maintaining that, as
the Boers had occupied Washbank when he joined their forces, he was not
then living on English territory.

"Signatures are being collected in Paris for an address 'to the Swiss

the extradition of the Russian Socialist Revolutionary Bromar
Vassilieff, who killed the Prefect of Police of Penza in January, 1906.
The address declares the deed of Bromar Vassilieff to have been purely
political. France, it contends, refused to surrender Hartmann, who had
taken part in the attempt against Alexander II. Italy refused to
extradite Michel Gotz, a member of the organization that assassinated
M. Sipiagin and M. Plehve. Sweden refused to give up Tcherniak, accused
of having participated in the attempt against M. Stolypin. Only a few
days ago, says this address, an Austrian jury acquitted Wanda
Kraguelska, who boasted of having thrown a bomb at the Governor-General
of Poland. The Swiss Republic, it adds, will not do what monarchies and
Empires have not done. It was deceived when it handed over to the
Russian authorities Belentsoff, who before his trial died from flogging
in prison. Free Switzerland having always done itself honour by
defending the political refugees of all nations against the largest
Powers, the signatories to the address feel certain that she will not
be false to this noble tradition by allowing Bromar Vassilieff to be

On May 12th, 1908, the <i>Petite R&#233;publique</i> published a telegram

troops had occurred at Porto Allegro. It appeared that several Spanish
smugglers were surprised while attempting to smuggle quantities of
tobacco and silk across the frontier into Portugal, and resisted the
Portuguese guards. A detachment of Spanish troops arrived on the scene
during the fight and crossed over on to Portuguese territory. Here they
were fired upon by the Portuguese, who, in the darkness, mistook them
for a second band of smugglers. The Spaniards together with the
smugglers now opened fire and a terrible fight ensued in which even
women took part. Before long, however, the Spaniards, who were
evidently under the impression that they, too, had to deal with
smugglers, discovered their error, and ceased fire, and the smugglers

At the same time his baggage was completely ransacked. He told the

Thereupon he takes the flag of his home state out of his pocket and
throws the folds of it over the fugitive for the purpose of protecting

In March, 1908, the <i>Westminster Gazette</i> contained the following
paragraph:
</p>

<p class="indent">
"On the first day of October last a gipsy van containing a family of
eight was escorted by Belgian gendarmes to the French frontier. On
attempting to cross the boundary the wanderers were stopped by French
gendarmes, who forbade any further advance. Thus beset behind and
before by the authorities, the van-dwellers perforce made the best of a
bad job, and resigned themselves to a long stay. On the whole, they
have had the best of it; for they, at any rate, had a comfortable roof
over their heads, while the four policemen who were on constant guard
by day and night, keeping the unwelcome travellers at bay, were exposed
to all the chances of the weather. Days, weeks, and months rolled
slowly by. February commenced, and still the gipsy-van stood on
no-man's-land, guarded by weary gendarmes, each drawing a franc and a
half a day, and wondering when the other side was going to give in, and
allow the gipsies to resume their wanderings. As far as is known the
van is there to-day, and nobody appears to care very much about its
fate. Perhaps in future years when the six gipsy children are grown up
and leave the old home, and its paintwork has grown still more shabby,
and the wheels have sunk up to their hubs into the soil, somebody will
come across it and the patient gendarmes, and begin asking questions.
Meantime the little comedy has already cost the French municipality of
Mont Saint-Martin more than 1,000 fr., while the local police force has
had to be helped by the neighbouring brigade to perform its ordinary
duties.
</p>

<p class="indent">
"It is true that negotiations are going on with a view to settling the
matter, but as four months have already passed since the van reached

"The indictment set forth the existence of a very skilfully devised
plot to kill the Governor-General. As he very seldom left the castle it
was necessary to do something to compel him to come out. Accordingly
one of the conspirators, in the uniform of a Russian officer, grossly
insulted the German Vice-Consul. It became necessary, therefore, for
the Governor-General to pay a personal visit to the Vice-Consul to
express his regret, officially, at such an occurrence. This was exactly
what the conspirators had reckoned upon, and they laid their plans
accordingly. Wanda Dobrodzicka, who was only twenty years of age, was,
it was alleged, entrusted with the task of killing the Governor.
According to the prosecution, she took up her position on a balcony
which he would pass, and when his carriage came she hurled a bomb at
it. The bomb, however, failed to explode. In the confusion the woman
escaped and succeeded in making her way to Trieste, going thence to
Italy and Switzerland, and afterwards coming to Galicia, where she
married and settled down.
</p>

<p class="indent">
"She was arrested on October 20th, 1907, and the Russian Government
demanded her extradition. As, however, through her marriage, she had
become an Austrian subject, the Galician authorities decided that she
must be tried in Galicia. The jury returned a verdict of 'Not guilty'
on both counts of the indictment. The accused was acquitted, and was
immediately released, as no notice of appeal was given by the Public
Prosecutor. The prisoner having been declared 'Not guilty' by the
Polish jury, notwithstanding her full admission of having thrown the
bombs, was accorded a great ovation by the crowd, who presented her
with flowers."

38. <i>Stratagem or Perfidy?</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
In 1783, during war between Great Britain and France, the
<i>Sybille</i>, a French frigate, enticed the <i>Hussar</i>, a British
man-of-war, by displaying the British flag and intimating herself to be
a distressed prize of a British captor. The <i>Hussar</i> approached to
succour her, but the latter at once attacked the <i>Hussar</i> without
shewing the French flag. She was, however, overpowered and captured.

39. <i>Murder of a German Consul in Mexico.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
In 1906 the German consul in Oaxaca, a town in the Mexican state of
Puebla, was murdered while in the house of a Mexican named Conttolene,
with whom he had had a dispute. Conttolene was arrested and prosecuted,
but acquitted. However his nephew, a Mexican named Rangel, gave himself
up for the crime and was condemned to two years' imprisonment. As this
punishment was considered too light the prosecuting counsel appealed,
but withdrew his appeal by order of the public prosecutor; and the
light sentence on Rangel was therefore allowed to stand. The German
government considered the punishment meted out to Rangel insufficient,
and made representations to the Mexican government complaining of the
fact that the appeal was withdrawn by order of the public prosecutor.
The Mexican government answered that it disapproved of the action of
the public prosecutor, because it recognised its international duty
sufficiently to protect the lives of foreigners in Mexico and to punish
adequately any murder of a foreign resident. On its recommendation the
governor of the state of Puebla deprived the public prosecutor
concerned of his office.

<p class="indent">
On June 27th, 1908, a telegram from Brody, in Eastern Galicia, stated
that a party of 14 Cossacks crossed the frontier into Austria,
plundered a house near Radziwilloff, shot dead the owner and his wife,
and cut off his daughter's hands and carried them away. They also
mutilated two other persons who were returning across the frontier.
Austrian gendarmes captured two of the Cossacks.

</p>

<p class="indent">
The natives of a small island in the possession of England rise and,
after murdering the majority of the whites, imprison the remainder. No
English man-of-war is on the spot, but the commander of a French war
vessel in the neighbourhood, who is informed of the insurrection by a
fugitive, resolves to interfere to save the lives of the surviving
whites. He therefore sails at once for the island, shells the harbour,
disembarks a number of men, relieves the white prisoners, and remains
in command of the island until an English man-of-war arrives on the
spot.

42. <i>Seizure of Ambassadors.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
The Marquis de Monti, the French envoy in Poland during a war between
Poland and Russia, being in Dantzic when, in 1734, that town
capitulated to the Russians, was seized and made prisoner because he
had taken an active part in the war; he was not released until 1736,
although France protested against his captivity.
</p>

<p class="indent">
When the Mar&#233;chal de Belle Isle, the French ambassador to Prussia,
passed, in 1774, on his way to Berlin, through Hanover, he was seized,
made a prisoner, and sent to England, which country, together with
Hanover, was then at war with France.

<p class="indent">
Baron de Wrech, who had for some time been minister plenipotentiary of

asked for his passports, the Duc d'Aiguillon, the French foreign
secretary, refused to deliver them to him before he had paid debts due
to the Marquis de Bezons and other creditors.

its general import duty on manufactured cotton goods coming from state
B, and that, in return for this reduction, the latter should reduce by
20 per cent. its general import duty on manufactured leather goods
coming from state A.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Some of the other states possessing commercial treaties with A and B,
which embody the most favoured nation clause, at once demand from A and

cotton and leather goods should also be granted to the imports from
their respective territories.

</p>

<p class="indent">
The following appeared in the papers on Dec. 4th, 1908, during a
revolution in Hayti, when the president Alexis had fled to a French
training ship in the harbour of Port-au-Prince:
</p>

<p class="ralign">
"<span class="sc">Port-au-Prince</span>, <i>Dec.</i> 2.
</p>

<p class="indent">
"President Nord Alexis is safe on board the French training ship
<i>Duguay Trouin</i>. At the last moment the President yielded to the
pleas of those about him, and precisely at five o'clock a salute of 21
guns announced his departure from the Palace.
</p>

<p class="indent">
"Previously to his departure the French Minister and other foreign
representatives, with a specially-formed committee, forced themselves
on the President, who finally consented to withdraw. Shouts and jeers
of derision greeted President Nord Alexis as he entered his carriage.
The French Minister sat beside him, and threw the folds of the Tricolor
over the shoulder of the President to protect him. Along the route the
people lining the streets greeted the President with curses. When he
arrived at the wharf the mob lost all restraint. Infuriated women
penetrated the cordon of troops, and shrieked the coarsest insults in
the face of President Alexis. The people tried to hurl themselves upon
him, fighting with hands and feet with the soldiers, who, in order to
disengage the President, discharged their muskets, and the crowd then
fell back. President Alexis, still draped in the Tricolor, boarded a
skiff, his suite tumbling in after him. Haitian, French, and American
warships fired a salute to the fallen President. As he was embarking a
woman aimed a blow at his side with a knife, but missed him. A man,
however, succeeded in striking the President a glancing blow on the
neck with his fist."

46. <i>A Murder in Monaco.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
In August, 1907, Mr. and Mrs. Goold, the Monte Carlo murderers, were
arrested in Marseilles, to which town they had succeeded in escaping
before the murder became known. The Monacan government demanded their
extradition and France was ready to comply with the request. Mrs.
Goold, however, was by birth of French nationality, and it was doubtful
whether she had been legally married to Mr. Goold. Under these
circumstances the French government refused to extradite Mrs. Goold,
before it had been proved by inquiries in England whether or not a
legal marriage had taken place between herself and Goold.
</p>


<p>
47. <i>A Question of Interpretation.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
According to Article XIII of the Treaty of July 11th, 1799,&#8212;confirmed
by Article XII of the Treaty of May 1st, 1828,&#8212;between the United
States of America and Prussia which is now valid for the whole German
empire, in case one of the contracting parties is a belligerent, no
articles carried by vessels of the other contracting party shall be
considered contraband, but nevertheless the belligerent party shall
have the right to seize any military stores carried by vessels of the
other party on payment of their full value.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Has the Declaration of London, 1909, any influence on the validity of
this old treaty stipulation?
</p>

<p class="indent">
If not, in the event of war between Germany and another power, can
powers possessing most favoured nation treaties with Germany claim the
same treatment with regard to contraband for their own vessels as
Germany must grant to vessels of the United States?

48. <i>The Island of Santa Lucia.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
In 1639 the island of Santa Lucia, in the Antilles, was occupied by
England, but in the following year the English settlers were massacred
by the natives, and no attempt was made by England to re-establish the
colony. In 1650 France, considering the island no man's land, took
possession of it. England, however, contended for many years that she
had not abandoned the island. After the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in
1748, the question of ownership was referred to the decision of certain
commissioners, and England claimed that having been driven out by force
she had not abandoned the island <i>sine spe redeundi</i>, and that
therefore France, in 1650, had no right to consider the island as no
man's land. Finally, by the peace treaty of Paris of 1763, England
resigned her claims.

Little Stukeley at a speed dangerous to the public, and which was
stated to be 36 miles an hour. The solicitor for the defendant, who did
not appear, claimed that he was exempt from proceedings such as these,
but admitted that he was not in a position to prove it. A letter of
explanation was read, which stated that it was very embarrassing to
have a servant charged with an offence against English law, and asking
that the charge be withdrawn. The bench decided to go on with the case,
and imposed a fine of &#163;12 and costs.

<p class="indent">
"Captain Calder, with a small armed force, went down the Barima river
and, crossing the boundary, invaded Venezuelan territory. He then
demanded at the point of the revolver that 4,000 pounds of balata, said
to have been won in a British forest, should be given up. The incident
has been reported to President Castro. Excitement prevails at
Morawhanna, the British frontier head-quarters, the people fearing
measures of retaliation. Trouble has been experienced for the past few
months in connexion with the balata trade, and British officers have
been keenly alert to prevent illicit trading. The Governor is now at
Lama, two days' journey from the capital. He is expected to arrive here
on Tuesday."

Felix Brown was born in London of German parents in 1875. He was
brought up in English schools and considered himself an Englishman,
although he knew that he was of German parentage and frequently went to
Germany to see his grandparents. In 1900 he was a passenger on an
English vessel destined for Riga. This vessel called on her way at
Stettin. While in that harbour the German police boarded the vessel and
arrested Brown for having evaded military service in Germany. Brown
telegraphed to the English ambassador in Berlin and asked for his
intervention.

During the second Hague Peace Conference the Emperor of Korea, although
he had signed in 1904 a treaty according to which Japan exercised a
protectorate over his country, dispatched an envoy and two secretaries
to the Hague for the purpose of bringing some complaints before the
Congress. One of the secretaries had been in Holland two years
previously, and had left the country without paying his debts. When his
creditors heard of his return, they asked an advocate whether they
could sue him, or whether he was exempted from Dutch jurisdiction,
since he now appeared as the secretary of the Korean envoy.

<p class="indent">
In 1905 the President of a South American Republic visited London with
the intention of undergoing an operation by a famous surgeon. He was
accompanied, among others, by Doctor Alcorta, his
physician-in-ordinary, who was watching the case. After dining with
friends one evening at a well-known restaurant, during which he drank
very freely of wine and liqueurs, Doctor Alcorta proceeded to the
Empire Theatre. He at first listened quietly, but, being displeased by
the song of one of the performers, he became noisy, had to be removed,
and on proving violent was handed over to the police. Next morning he
was brought up before a magistrate on the charge of having been drunk
and disorderly.
</p>


<p>
54. <i>Extradition of a British Subject.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
The following is a cutting from the police court reports of a daily
paper:
</p>

<p class="indent">
"At Bow-street, Julius Kuhliger, <i>alias</i> Nollier, 35, of
Field-road, Forest-gate, was again brought up before Sir A. de Rutzen
for extradition on the charge of obtaining money by false pretences in
Belgium. Mr H. Lewis defended. In consequence of certain complaints
Detective-sergeant Brogden kept observation upon a newsagent's shop in
Shoreditch, and on the 2nd inst. he saw the prisoner call there and
receive several letters. He followed the prisoner and saw him examine
the contents, and then arrested him. The letters were found to contain
four money orders of the total value of &#163;6. 7<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i>, and
the prisoner was brought up at the Old-street Police-court and charged
with being in the unlawful possession of them. It was afterwards
discovered that the orders were the proceeds of an alleged swindle in
Belgium which had been carried on from this country, and the original
charge was abandoned in favour of the extradition proceedings.
Detective-sergeant Brogden now gave evidence that the prisoner claimed
to be a British subject, alleging that his mother was English, though
his father was a Swiss. Since his arrest he had made a statement to the
effect that about three months ago, finding himself in financial
difficulties, he thought he would embark upon a system of fraud. He
advertised in the German newspapers, he continued, stating that an
English lady wished to send her two daughters to Germany for the
purpose of learning the language of the country. Several persons
replied offering to take the children, and he wrote to each of them
accepting their offer, and stating that the luggage had already been
sent on. He followed this by another letter purporting to come from a
firm of railway carriers, saying that they had been instructed to
forward certain trunks, and would do so on the receipt of their fees in
advance. He arranged for the replies to these letters to be sent to
five or six different newsagents' shops in various parts of London, and
each place brought him in an average of about &#163;10. The prisoner, on
oath, now said that he was a British subject, and Mr Lewis asked the
magistrate to say that this was not a case in which he ought to
surrender the prisoner to a foreign Power. The magistrate said that
with regard to the point raised as to the accused's being a British
subject, the article in the Treaty with Belgium dealing with that
matter said that 'in no case or on any consideration whatever shall the
high contracting parties be bound to surrender their own subjects
whether by birth or naturalization.' It had been held that such
provision implied that the high contracting parties might surrender
their own subjects, and that such surrender must be left to the
discretion of the Secretary of State. He ordered the prisoner to be
committed for extradition, and it would be for the Home Secretary to
decide whether it was a case in which he ought not to sanction the
surrender."
</p>


<p>
55. <i>The Case of the "Oldhamia."</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
The following appeared in the <i>Times</i> of Dec. 14th, 1908, dated St
Petersburg, Dec. 13th:
</p>

<p class="indent">
"The Admiralty Appeal Court yesterday confirmed the judgment of the
Libau Prize Court justifying the capture and destruction of the British
steamer <i>Oldhamia</i>, bound fur Hong-kong with American oil. She was
taken by the cruiser <i>Oleg</i> of Admiral Rozhdestvensky's fleet off
Formosa on the night of May 18, 1905, and a fortnight later, while
proceeding to Vladivostok, struck on the Kurile reef and was burned by
the prize crew to prevent her from falling into the hands of the
Japanese. The Court disallowed a claim for damages by the captain and
crew for the loss of their personal effects on the formal grounds that
the claim had not been presented at the first hearing of the case. It
allowed a claim of the Standard Oil Company to recover the cost of 200
empty kerosene cases. It confirmed the Libau verdict disallowing the
claims of the Manchester and Salford Company, the owners of the vessel,
for &#163;61,580, and those of the Standard Oil Company for cargo consisting
of 149,462 cases of kerosene, valued at $123,134 (&#163;24,627).
</p>

<p class="indent">
"The circumstances of the capture were fully detailed at the trial
before the Libau Prize Court on June 12, 1907. The arguments presented
by Mr. Berlin, counsel for the plaintiffs, and the law officers of the
Crown, bore first upon the <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the
<i>Oldhamia's</i> destination and cargo, and secondly, on the point
whether kerosene rightly came under the Russian declaration of
contraband of war. It was admitted that the cargo was intended for
Japan, but solely for commercial purposes. The principal legal adviser
to the Admiralty submitted, however, that kerosene was now used also as
a fuel for warships. Moreover, the vessel was considerably out of her
course. The captain was unable to produce the charter-party or bills of
lading, and one of the seamen declared that she carried guns at the
bottom of the hold. Admiral Rozhdestvensky sent 300 sailors to displace
the cargo in order to verity this statement, but they worked for two
days without getting lower than the main deck. Mr. Berlin invoked the
fact that the Procurator at Libau declined to recognize kerosene as
contraband within the meaning of the Russian declaration, which
specifically mentions naphtha. He argued at length on the question of
conditional and absolute contraband of war. Upon these points the
Russian and British views have been, and remain, at variance, as
exemplified in all the prize cases connected with the late war.
</p>

<p class="indent">
"The result of the present appeal, however onerous to the owners,
cannot be regarded as unexpected. A member of the Embassy staff
attended the proceedings in behalf of the British Government."

56. <i>An Ambassadors Estate.</i>

Musurus Pasha, the Turkish ambassador in London, died there in December
1907. In February, 1908, Mme Musurus took out letters of administration
in England, and proceeded to pay the debts and the death duties payable
in respect of the property in this country. The greater part of the
ambassador's estate was situated in Turkey and Thessaly, and the only
property in England was certain shares in companies. Two of the
next-of-kin of the ambassador brought (in December 1908) an action to
obtain the administration of his estate and also an injunction
restraining Mme Musurus from removing any of the assets out of the
jurisdiction of the English courts, or from dealing with them otherwise
than in due course of administration.

"While a balloon, belonging to the Silesian Aeronautic Club, was
sailing along at about 100 m&#232;tres distance from the Russo-German
frontier on Saturday over Krotoschin, Sarotschin, and Zockow, 15 shots
were fired at it from Russian territory, probably by frontier Cossacks.
The weather was fine and the German flag hung from the envelope. Nobody
was hurt, only one shot striking a sandbag, and the balloon landed
safely on German soil."
</p>


<p>
58. <i>Family Honour.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
In February, 1906, Carlo Waddington, the son of the Chilian envoy at
Brussels, shot at and killed Balmaceda, the secretary of the Chilian
Legation. The cause of this action was that Balmaceda refused to marry
Waddington's sister, whom he had previously seduced.

59. <i>An Ocean Chase.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
Recently in the Firth of Clyde the Fishery Board's cruiser
<i>Vigilant</i> observed a foreign trawler operating, it was alleged,
within the three-mile limit of Ailsa Craig. The trawler made off, and a
stern chase of over 20 miles, lasting about two hours, followed. The
<i>Vigilant</i> fired several shots, to which the trawler paid no heed,
but ultimately the cruiser caught up the fugitive and compelled her to
stop. The mate of the <i>Vigilant</i> boarded the trawler, the captain
of which refused to accompany the <i>Vigilant</i> to Campbeltown, and,
after the officer had obtained particulars of the boat and the crew,
the trawler left for Fleetwood with the week's catch. The
<i>Vigilant</i> proceeded to Campbeltown and reported the matter to the
Crown authorities.

The vessel, the <i>Maori King</i>, was purchased in March, 1906, by
Messrs. Ginsburg and Co., a Russian firm. To enable the vessel to sail
under the British flag, all the shares in her were nominally
transferred to a British subject named Dow, who registered her in
Shanghai as a British-owned vessel. Subsequently she sailed under the
British flag from Vladivostok to Guaymos, in Mexico, carrying 921
Chinese coolies and 217 Russians. In January, 1908, the British
consul-general in Shanghai seized the vessel as liable to forfeiture
under &#167;&#167; 69 and 76 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.

<p class="indent">
A policeman, stationed at the corner of Bond Street and Oxford Street
for the purpose of regulating traffic, raises his hand as a sign for
carriages coming from Bond Street to stop. One of the drivers ignores
this sign and drives on. The policeman seizes the horse's head and
stops the carriage, whereupon a gentleman within complains, maintaining
that he is an ambassador to the English Court and that the police have
no right to stop him. As the policeman does not give way the ambassador
leaves his carriage and, going immediately to the Foreign Office,
complains of the violation of his privileges and demands the punishment
of the policeman.

<p class="indent">
In 1900 Oscar Meyer, a German by birth, who is naturalised in England
without having ceased to be a German subject, marries an Englishwoman
in London. In the following year he obtains a judicial separation from
his wife. As his marriage was never known in Germany, he succeeds in
1902, while staying in Berlin, in marrying his niece, whom he brings
back to England as his wife. In 1905 the niece finds out that Meyer was
already a married man when he married her, and has him arrested for

66. <i>The Expulsion of Monsieur de Reus.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
The following appeared in the papers of July 22nd, 1908, dated Caracas,
July 21st:
</p>

<p class="indent">
"President Castro has expelled M. J. H. de Reus, the Dutch Minister
Resident here. Dr. Paul, Minister for Foreign Affairs, sent his
passports to M. de Reus with a note informing him that, in view of the
opinions expressed by M. de Reus in a letter written on April 9th,
President Castro declares him to be incompetent to serve as a friendly
medium in the relations between Venezuela and the Netherlands.
</p>

<p class="indent">
"The letter referred to is probably M. de Reus's reply to President
Castro's demand that Holland should exercise more effectual vigilance
over Dutch vessels plying between La Guaira and Cura&#231;ao, in which
Venezuelan revolutionaries frequently effect their escape under assumed
names. This preceded the trouble caused by the closing of the port of
Cura&#231;ao to Venezuelan shipping on account of plague at La Guaira."

67. <i>The Case of McLeod.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
Alexander McLeod was a member of the British force sent by the Canadian
government in 1837 into the territory of the United States for the
purpose of capturing the <i>Caroline</i>, which vessel had been
equipped for crossing into Canadian territory and taking help to the
Canadian insurgents. In 1841 McLeod came on business into the State of
New York, and was arrested and indicted for the killing of one Amos
Durfee, a citizen of the United States, on the occasion of the capture
of the <i>Caroline</i>.

<p>
68. <i>A Thwarted Suicide.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
While the <i>Frau Elizabeth</i>, a German tramp steamer, is on the high
seas during a voyage between New York and Hamburg, a sailor, Heinrich
Kalke, jumps overboard with the intention of drowning himself. Another
sailor leaps into the sea after him in the hope of saving Kalke's life.
He succeeds in getting hold of the man, but Kalke struggles and, being
unable to free himself, draws a knife and stabs the sailor, who
thereupon sinks. While the struggle is in progress the vessel slackens
speed, a boat is lowered, and its occupants succeed in securing Kalke.
He is taken on board, conveyed to Hamburg, and there put on his trial
for murder. Counsel for defence asserts that Germany does not possess
jurisdiction, as the act was committed, not on a vessel sailing under
the German flag, but in the sea itself, and as, according to &#167; 4, No. 3
of the German criminal code, a German can only be punished in Germany
for an act committed abroad, if the act concerned is punishable both by
the law of Germany and by that of the country where the act was
committed.

The following appeared in the papers, dated St Petersburg, Feb. 4th,
1908:
</p>

<p class="indent">
"M. Bompard, the French Ambassador, regarding a recent paragraph in the
<i>Grazhdanin</i> as insulting, has addressed himself to M. Isvolsky,
Minister for Foreign Affairs, complaining that the statement in
question was directed against himself in his capacity of representative
of the French Republic in Russia. He therefore asks for the protection
of the Imperial Government. Since the Press laws contain no provision
for the criminal prosecution of newspapers for insults offered to
representatives of friendly Powers, a decree has been issued whereby
the Prefect of St Petersburg, in virtue of the powers conferred upon
him under the law on 'extraordinary protection,' has inflicted upon the
editor of the <i>Grazhdanin</i> a fine of 1,000 roubles (&#163;100)."

</p>

<p class="indent">
Edward Wolff, a German subject, domiciled in England since 1860, goes
to Germany in 1870 for the purpose of there marrying his niece. He at
once returns to England with his bride, and becomes naturalized in
1871. His wife dies in 1873 in giving birth to a son. In 1875 he
marries an Englishwoman in London. As the result of this marriage a
second son is born in 1876. In 1900 Wolff dies without leaving a will,
six months after the death of his second wife. The son of the second
wife claims the whole of his father's estate, maintaining that the
first marriage of his father was invalid and that therefore his
step-brother, being illegitimate, could not inherit.

71. <i>The Coachman of an Envoy.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
In 1827 a coachman of Mr. Gallatin, the American minister in London,

<p class="indent">
Amelia Island, at the mouth of St Mary's River, in Florida, was, in
1817, seized by a number of adventurers under the command of one
McGregor, who, in the name of the insurgent colonies of Buenos Ayres
and Venezuela, preyed not only on the commerce of Spain but also on
that of the United States. The island was, at that time, part of
Spanish territory; and as the Spanish government was not able to put an
end to the nuisance created to the United States by the seizure, the
latter ordered a man-of-war to expel McGregor and his men from Amelia
Island, to destroy their works and vessels, and to take possession of
the island for the purpose of preventing the recurrence of the
nuisance.

On Jan. 15th, 1909, after the dismissal of Yuan-Shih-Kai, the British
and the American diplomatic envoys at Peking called by appointment on
Prince Ching, who, as president of the Grand Council and the Wai-wu-pu,
is the highest official of the Chinese Empire. The purpose of the
appointment was to make a joint representation on the part of the two
powers regarding the dismissal, without any given reason, of
Yuan-Shih-Kai, whose services to the cause of order, stability, and
progress in China had inspired such confidence in their two
governments.

The following appeared in the <i>Times</i>, Dec. 9th, 1908:
</p>

<p class="indent">
"The claim of Herr von Bethmann-Hollweg, a German Embassy official, to
be exempt from rates in respect of his residence at Walton-on-Thames
was before the urban council last night.
</p>

<p class="indent">
"A letter was read from the Rating of Government Property Department of
the Treasury stating that houses occupied by representatives of foreign
Powers and the accredited members of their suites were liable to
assessment in common with other property of the country, but as their
persons and personal effects were by international law exempt from
seizure if they refused to pay rates these could not be enforced
against them by process of law. Reciprocal arrangements had, however,
been entered into with certain Powers, Germany being one of them, under
which a contribution in lieu of rates was given by the Government to
local authorities in respect of such occupations.
</p>

<p class="indent">
"The Walton Council, in common, it is believed, with many other local
authorities in the country, had held the view that it was impossible to
recover rates under such circumstances, but their attention was drawn
to the present case by the Local Government Board auditor, at whose
suggestion they wrote to the Treasury, with the above result."

<p class="indent">
The attach&#233; of an embassy in Paris during a dispute with his servant

but he refuses to obey, leaves the embassy, and settles down in Paris.
Thereupon his government demands his extradition from France.

<p class="indent">
On July 14th, 1805, during the war between Great Britain and Spain, the
British privateer <i>Minerva</i> captured the Spanish vessel
<i>Anna</i>, near the mouth of the river Mississippi. When brought
before the British prize court in November, 1805, the United States
claimed the captured vessel, on the ground that the capture was
effected within the American territorial maritime belt. From the
evidence brought forward it appeared that the <i>Anna</i> was captured
at a spot five miles from the mainland, but that there were several
small mud islands composed of earth and trees, which had drifted down
the river and had fixed themselves more than two miles off the shore.

80. <i>The Punishment for Murder.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
In 1905 Henry Johnson, an English subject, commits a murder in London
but succeeds in escaping. In 1906 he appears in Rome under the name of
Charles Waiter and commits a murder there also. During his trial at
Rome his real name and antecedents are disclosed and reported in
England. As the Italian penal code does not provide capital punishment
and he is therefore only condemned to penal servitude for life, the
question is raised in the English Press whether England could not
demand the extradition of the murderer, so that he might be tried and
executed in England for the murder committed there.

In 1670 Frederick William, the great elector of Brandenburg, ordered
his diplomatic envoy at Warsaw, the capital of Poland, to obtain
possession of the person of one Colonel von Kalkstein, a Prussian
subject, who had fled to Poland for political reasons, as he was

<p class="indent">
During a war between states A and B, a general armistice is concluded,
without detailed stipulations. The commander of the forces of state A
is informed through spies that the enemy is throwing up defences within
the line where the forces face each other and is concentrating twice as
many troops in that place as had been there before the conclusion of

fearing an attack, at once recommences hostilities, without any
previous denunciation of the armistice.

extradition, maintaining that, as the crime was committed inside the
Russian embassy, it fell exclusively within Russian jurisdiction.

In January, 1905, the Russian general St&#246;ssel, the commander of Port

</p>

<p class="indent">
"A mass meeting took place to-day at Lemberg, the capital of Galicia,
to protest against the Polish policy of Prussia and Prince B&#252;low's
Expropriation Bill. Some 10,000 persons were present. In a much
applauded address, the vice-burgomaster condemned Prince B&#252;low's action
and called upon the Polish representatives in the forthcoming
Austro-Hungarian Delegations to vote against the Foreign Office
estimates. After the meeting, the police prevented an attempt to make a
demonstration against the German Imperial Consulate. The demonstrators
carried large caricatures of the Emperor William, Prince B&#252;low, and
Baron von Aehrenthal."
</p>

<p class="indent">
"To-day's reports show yesterday's anti-Prussian demonstration at
Lemberg to have been accompanied by some excesses. After the meeting a
number of demonstrators succeeded in breaking through the cordon of
police and in reaching the hotel where the German Consul has hitherto
lived. Several windows were smashed, and, in order to avoid an attack
upon the hotel, the hotel-keeper declared that he had already given the
Consul notice to quit and that the Consul had departed. The proposal of
a student that no inhabitant of Lemberg should give the German Consul
shelter on pain of being considered a traitor to the Polish cause was

"Last night the steamer <i>Sophia</i> was seized by armed robbers 16
miles from Odessa, while on a voyage from this port to Korthion. At 11
o'clock three young men appeared on the deck, where the captain and the
passengers were at supper, and held them in check while two others
seized the man at the wheel and ordered him, under threat of death, to
set the ship's course for Odessa. Some of the robbers, who appear to
have numbered 18 in all, then went into the first-class saloon, where
they took possession of an iron cash-box containing 50,000 roubles
(&#163;5,000), which was in charge of a cashier of the Russian Bank for
Foreign Trade. They also took 1,000 roubles (&#163;100) belonging to the
passengers. The robbers then proceeded to disable the engines, and let
off all the steam, and finally made their escape in two of the
<i>Sophia</i>'s boats after destroying the third. The police are

<p class="indent">
The <i>Times</i> of Dec. 4th, 1908, contained the following telegram,
dated Paris, Dec. 3rd:
</p>

<p class="indent">
"The French Government will come to a decision at the Cabinet Council
to be held on Saturday as to the conditions upon which President
Castro, the despot of Venezuela, will be allowed to land in France. At
the moment of his departure for Europe it was reported that the object
of the President's journey was to see a distinguished specialist with a
view to a surgical operation. Since then, however, trustworthy
information has reached the Quai d'Orsay to the effect that his state
of health is not so precarious as it had been reported to be, and that
he looks forward to receiving in Paris the hospitality to which South
Americans are accustomed. If that be the case, there are serious
reasons for believing that he will meet with disappointment. The
relations between France and Venezuela have been suspended now for
several years, and the French representative at Caracas, it will be
remembered, was expelled from Venezuela. The French Foreign Office is
at present engaged in preparing a statement of its grievances against
President Castro, to serve as a basis for the discussion in the next
Cabinet Council of the delicate questions raised by the Dictator's
decision to visit this country."
</p>

<p class="indent">
Again, the <i>Times</i> of Dec. 11th contained the following, dated
Paris, Dec. 10th:
</p>

<p class="indent">
"President Castro landed in France this morning from the steamer
<i>Guadeloupe</i> at Pauillac, where he was met by the Venezuelan
Consul at Genoa and a dozen or more friends. He took a special train
from Bordeaux, and on arriving with his wife, brother, three doctors,
and six servants, he allowed himself to be photographed, subsequently
driving to the H&#244;tel de France. On reaching the hotel he received a
visit from M. Gout, a high official at the Quai d'Orsay, who had been
specially despatched by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to inform
President Castro of the conditions on which the Government has allowed
him to land in France, and on which he will be permitted to stay here.
The Government has refused to reveal the details of the decision at
which it arrived in the Cabinet Council of last Saturday as to its
treatment of the Venezuelan President. He declared to the
representative of the French Foreign Office that he had come to Europe
as a mere private individual to see a doctor, but a semi-official note
communicated this evening states that 'it is believed that he will take
advantage of his stay to try to settle his affairs with the various
Powers which no longer have agents accredited to his Government.'
</p>

<p class="indent">
"There is reason to believe that this very guarded and somewhat
enigmatical statement marks the definite decision of the French
Government to demand from President Castro a complete settlement of all
the questions outstanding between him and this country. It is felt that
while France cannot repudiate her traditions of hospitality, she has
nevertheless seized this opportunity to make it quite clear to the
President that any prolongation of his sojourn here must depend on his
meeting the views of the French Government."

<p class="indent">
In April, 1893, the Viceroy Li Hung Chang granted the exclusive right
of the free importation of grain into Tien-Tsin to the China Merchants
Steamship Navigation Company. England protested against this monopoly,
because it was contrary to Article 3 of the Treaty of Commerce between
China and the United States, the benefits of which England could claim
in consequence of the most favoured nation clause in her own treaties
with China. The Chinese government answered that the United States had,
by passing the Chinese Exclusion Act, broken the commercial treaty
concerned, that therefore the treaty had come to an end, and that no
one could, under the most favoured nation clause, claim any longer the
benefits of a treaty which had ceased to exist. (See Lehr, in the

</p>

<p class="indent">
The following appeared in the <i>Times</i> of May 10th, 1909:
</p>

<p class="indent">
"A Russian, who described himself as Colonel von Kotten, chief of the
Moscow secret police, was shot at yesterday by an escaped Russian
convict, Michael Vitkoff, at an hotel in the Rue Bolivar, where the two
men met by appointment. According to the police officer's story,
Vitkoff was a Polish revolutionary who had been sentenced to
deportation to Siberia, but who had been reprieved upon volunteering to
act as a police spy on the movements of his revolutionary comrades.
Vitkoff subsequently came to Paris, and upon the arrival of the police
officer in the French capital a few days ago he induced Colonel von
Kotten to visit him upon the pretext that he had important information
to communicate. No sooner had the officer entered Vitkoff's room than
the latter fired several shots at him with a revolver, none of which,
however, took effect. A hand-to-hand struggle followed, in which
Vitkoff was worsted. The man succeeded in making his escape, but gave
himself up at the nearest police station, where he told his story,
which was confirmed by Colonel von Kotten, who arrived shortly
afterwards little the worse for his experience. Vitkoff was taken into
custody and will be charged with attempted murder.
</p>

<p class="indent">
"Minute details of the attack upon Colonel von Kotten are published,
but they shed little or no light upon the motives of the aggression. In
some quarters it is suggested that, unless Vitkoff's action was purely
personal, it may have been dictated by a desire on the part of the
Russian revolutionaries to secure by means of a judicial trial in
France the publicity which even the Azeff and Feodoroff cases have
failed to gain for their efforts to expose the activity of the Russian
secret police."

100. <i>The Detention of Napoleon I.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
The question is frequently discussed whether the detention of Napoleon
I at St Helena was or was not in accordance with international law. The
facts of the case are as follows: After having abdicated the throne of
France in favour of his son, Napoleon thought of taking refuge in
America, and therefore set out for the port of Rochefort. Arriving
there on July 3rd, 1815, he found the harbour watched by a British
fleet. After some days of deliberation he made up his mind to throw
himself on the mercy of the English people, and therefore on July 13th
he wrote to the Prince Regent that he came to take his seat at the
hearth of the British people and that he placed himself under the
protection of the British laws. On July 15th he went on board the
English ship the <i>Bellerophon</i> and gave himself into the charge of
her captain, by whom he was conveyed to England. On August 7th Napoleon

instructed to convey him, together with a suite of twenty-five persons,
to the island of St Helena. He arrived on Oct. 17th and remained there
a prisoner of state up to the day of his death on May 5th, 1821.
